# Endless_GAME_Using_Body_Movement-
This is an innovative AI-based endless runner game where the player controls the character using real-world body movements captured through a webcam. Jump, move left, or move right — all by physically performing the actions in front of the camera! Say goodbye to keyboards and controllers — you are the controller.
